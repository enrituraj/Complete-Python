### Python Tuple

1. Write a Python program to create a tuple of integers. Then, print each element of the tuple using a `for` loop.

2. Create a tuple with mixed data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings). Write a program to display the type of each element in the tuple.

3. Write a Python program to check if an element exists in a tuple. If it exists, print the index of the element.

4. Write a Python program to convert a tuple into a list, modify the list, and convert it back into a tuple.

5. Create a program that takes a tuple of numbers as input from the user and prints the sum, minimum, and maximum values.

### Access and Update

6. Write a Python program to access the first and last elements of a tuple. Use both positive and negative indexing.

7. Write a Python program to slice a tuple. Extract elements from index 2 to 5 from the tuple `(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)`.

8. Write a program to demonstrate that tuples are immutable by attempting to change an element of a tuple. Handle the error gracefully.

9. Write a Python program that creates a tuple, converts it to a list, updates an element of the list, and then converts the list back into a tuple.

10. Create a Python program to access the elements of a tuple using a `for` loop, printing both the index and the element.

### Unpacking

11. Write a Python program that unpacks the tuple `(1, 2, 3)` into three variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, and prints the values of these variables.

12. Create a tuple containing 5 elements and unpack the first two elements into individual variables, while the remaining elements are stored in another variable using the `*` operator.

13. Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables using tuple unpacking.

14. Write a Python program that takes a tuple of three elements (name, age, city) and unpacks them into individual variables.

15. Create a Python program that accepts a tuple with different lengths of sequences and unpacks them using extended unpacking (`*` operator).

### Join

16. Write a Python program to join two tuples into one. Display the result of concatenating `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`.

17. Create a program to concatenate multiple tuples and print the result.

18. Write a Python program to join two tuples, but before joining, check if both tuples contain at least one common element. If yes, concatenate them, otherwise return an error message.

19. Write a Python program to repeat a tuple `n` times using the `*` operator. Take `n` as input from the user.

20. Write a Python program to join a tuple of strings into a single string, separated by spaces or a given delimiter.

### Tuple Methods

21. Write a Python program to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the `count()` method.

22. Create a Python program to find the index of a specified element in a tuple using the `index()` method.

23. Write a Python program to find and print the first occurrence of the number 5 in a tuple. If the element is not found, handle the error gracefully.

24. Write a Python program to create a tuple, find the length of the tuple using the `len()` function, and print the result.

25. Create a Python program that demonstrates the immutability of tuples by trying to modify an element. Then, show how tuple methods like `index()` and `count()` can still work.
