# tuple having two methods
    # 1. count - Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
    # 2. index - Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
print(my_tuple)

print(my_tuple.count(2)) # number of occurrences of 2 = 1.
print(my_tuple.index(5)) # index of 5 = 4
