### Data Types Theory

1. Write a Python program that accepts different types of inputs (integer, float, string,Boolean) from the user and displays the data type of each input.

2. Write a program that reads a user input and checks whether it's a valid integer, float, or string. Print an appropriate message for each case.

### Immutable & Mutable

1. Write a Python program to demonstrate immutability by attempting to modify a string after creation. Catch any errors and print an explanation.

2. Write a program to create a list and modify it by adding and removing elements. Show how the list changes with each operation.


### Numbers

1. Write a Python program to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus) on two numbers provided by the user.

2. Create a Python program to generate and print a random number between 1 and 100. Use the `random` module.

3. Write a Python program to calculate the square root of a given number. Use the `math` module and handle non-positive inputs appropriately.

4. Write a program to accept a floating-point number from the user and round it to 2 decimal places. Print both the original and rounded values.

5. Create a program that converts a user input from degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

### Strings

1. Write a Python program to input a string from the user and count how many vowels and consonants are in the string.

2. Create a Python program that accepts a sentence from the user and reverses the order of the words in the sentence.

3. Write a Python program to remove all occurrences of a specific character from a string provided by the user.

4. Write a Python program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in a different order).

5. Write a Python program to capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence without using the `title()` method.
