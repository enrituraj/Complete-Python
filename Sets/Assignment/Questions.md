### Sets in Python

1. Write a Python program to create a set of integers and print all its elements. Demonstrate that sets do not allow duplicate values.

2. Create a Python program that initializes a set with multiple data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats). Display the set and verify that it can hold elements of different types.

3. Write a program to create a set of numbers. Check whether a specified number is present in the set using the `in` keyword and print an appropriate message.

4. Write a Python program to convert a list into a set and print both the original list and the converted set. Note the differences in the order of elements.

5. Write a Python program to convert a string into a set of characters. Use a string input from the user.

### Access, Update, and Remove Items from a Set

6. Write a Python program to add a single item to an existing set using the `add()` method and print the updated set.

7. Write a Python program to update a set by adding multiple elements (e.g., from a list or another set) using the `update()` method.

8. Write a program to remove a specified element from a set using the `remove()` method. Handle the case when the element does not exist in the set by catching the `KeyError`.

9. Write a Python program to discard an element from a set using the `discard()` method and explain how it differs from `remove()`.

10. Create a Python program that uses the `pop()` method to remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. Print the set before and after using `pop()`.

### Join Operations

11. Write a Python program to perform the union of two sets and print the result. Demonstrate the `union()` method.

12. Write a Python program to find the intersection of two sets using the `intersection()` method and print the common elements.

13. Create a Python program to find the difference between two sets (i.e., elements that exist in the first set but not in the second) using the `difference()` method.

14. Write a Python program to compute the symmetric difference of two sets using the `symmetric_difference()` method and explain its purpose.

15. Write a Python program to check if one set is a subset of another using the `issubset()` method. If it is, print an appropriate message.

### Loop Over Sets

16. Write a Python program that iterates over a set of numbers and prints only the even numbers.

17. Write a Python program to iterate over a set of words and print each word along with its length.

18. Create a program that creates a set of unique elements from a list and then loops over the set to print all elements that are greater than a specified value.

19. Write a Python program that iterates over two sets simultaneously and prints the common elements found in both sets.

20. Write a Python program that uses a `for` loop to add all elements of a set of integers and prints the total sum.

### Set Methods in Python

21. Write a Python program to check if two sets are disjoint (i.e., they have no elements in common) using the `isdisjoint()` method.

22. Write a Python program to check if a set is a superset of another set using the `issuperset()` method. Print a message indicating whether the first set contains all elements of the second.

23. Write a Python program to clear all elements from a set using the `clear()` method. Print the set before and after clearing.

24. Create a Python program that creates a frozen set using the `frozenset()` function and attempts to modify it. Explain why this is not possible by catching the error.

25. Write a Python program that copies a set using the `copy()` method. Modify the original set and demonstrate that the copied set remains unaffected.
