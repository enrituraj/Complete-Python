- Deep Dive In Conditional & Loops
    

    
    ### Conditional Statements
    
    1. Write a Python program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using `if-else`.
    2. Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input and prints the largest one using nested `if-else`.
    3. Write a program to check whether a character is a vowel or consonant using `if-else`.
    4. Write a Python program that checks if a given year is a leap year using `if-elif-else`.
    5. Write a Python program to determine if a given number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
    
    ### Loops (For, While)
    
    1. Write a Python program to print all numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop.
    2. Write a Python program to print the multiplication table of a given number using a `while` loop.
    3. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is user input) using a `for` loop.
    4. Write a Python program to reverse a number using a `while` loop.
    5. Write a Python program to print all prime numbers between 1 and 50 using a `for` loop.
    
    ### Nested Loops
    
    1. Write a Python program to print the following pattern using nested `for` loops:
        
        ```
        *
        **
        ***
        ****
        *****
        
        ```
        
    2. Write a Python program to print a multiplication table from 1 to 10 using nested `for` loops.
    3. Write a Python program to print the following pattern using nested loops:
        
        ```
        1
        12
        123
        1234
        
        ```
        
    4. Write a Python program that checks whether a number is prime or not using nested loops.
    5. Write a Python program to print the following pattern using nested `for` loops:
        
        ```
        *****
        ****
        ***
        **
        *
        
        ```
        
    
    ### Control Flow (continue, break, pass)
    
    1. Write a Python program that prints numbers from 1 to 10, but skips the number 5 using the `continue` statement.
    2. Write a Python program that accepts input from the user until they enter a negative number, using the `break` statement to exit.
    3. Write a Python program that counts from 1 to 10, but uses the `pass` statement inside the loop. (Explain its use in comments.)
    4. Write a Python program to print the first 10 numbers, but stop the loop if the sum of the numbers exceeds 30, using the `break` statement.
    
    ### Match Statement (Python 3.10+)
    
    1. Write a Python program using the `match` statement to implement a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.
    2. Write a Python program using the `match` statement to determine the type of a triangle (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene) based on the lengths of its sides.
    3. Write a Python program that uses the `match` statement to classify a given day of the week (input as a number 1-7) into "Weekday" or "Weekend."
    4. Write a Python program using the `match` statement to check a student's grade based on their score (A, B, C, D, or F).
    5. Write a Python program that uses the `match` statement to map a month number (1-12) to its corresponding season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).
