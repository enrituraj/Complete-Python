### Lists in Python

1. Write a Python program to create a list of integers from user input and print the sum of all the elements in the list.

2. Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints the largest and smallest elements in the list without using built-in functions like `max()` and `min()`.

3. Create a Python program to remove all occurrences of a specified element from a list. The element and list should be provided by the user.

4. Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of a specified element in a list with another value provided by the user.

5. Write a Python program to merge two lists into a single list. Then, remove any duplicate elements from the merged list and print the result.

### List Comprehension

6. Use list comprehension to create a list of squares of all numbers from 1 to 20.

7. Write a Python program using list comprehension to extract all even numbers from a given list of integers.

8. Create a list of tuples using list comprehension, where each tuple contains a number and its square, for numbers between 1 and 10.

9. Write a program to filter out words from a list that are shorter than 5 characters using list comprehension.

10. Use list comprehension to convert a list of Celsius temperatures `[0, 10, 20, 30]` to Fahrenheit.

### Copying Lists

11. Write a Python program that demonstrates the difference between shallow copy and deep copy by copying a nested list. Modify the original list and show how the copies are affected.

12. Create a program to copy a list using slicing. Modify the original list and demonstrate that the copy remains unchanged.

13. Write a Python program to clone or copy a list using the `copy()` method. Verify that changes to the original list do not affect the copied list.

14. Create a Python program to copy a list using list comprehension. Modify the original list and show that the copy remains unaffected.

15. Write a Python program to create a deep copy of a list using the `copy` module. Demonstrate how changes in the nested list of the original do not affect the copied list.

### Sorting Lists

16. Write a Python program to sort a list of numbers in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Also, sort the list in descending order.

17. Create a Python program to sort a list of strings by their lengths. Use the `key` argument in the `sort()` method.

18. Write a program to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key (e.g., sorting a list of student dictionaries by their age).

19. Use the `sorted()` function to sort a list of tuples where each tuple contains a person's name and their age. Sort the list based on the age.

20. Write a Python program to reverse a list using both `reverse()` method and list slicing. Compare the results.

### Methods Applicable on Lists

21. Write a Python program to append an item to a list and remove the last element using `append()` and `pop()`.

22. Create a Python program to count the occurrences of a specific item in a list using the `count()` method.

23. Write a program to find the index of a specific element in a list using the `index()` method.

24. Write a Python program to extend a list with another list using the `extend()` method and demonstrate how it differs from `append()`.

25. Create a Python program that uses the `insert()` method to add an element at a specified position in the list.
