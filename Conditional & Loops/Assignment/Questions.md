Here is a list of Python practice questions with hints for variable names:

### Python Practice Questions

1. **Write a program to determine if a number is odd or even, taking input from the user.**
   - **Hint:** Use the variable `num` for the number input.

2. **Accept a name from the user and display a personalized greeting message.**
   - **Hint:** Use the variable `name` to store the user's name and print a greeting.

3. **Create a program to input principal, rate, and time (P, R, T) from the user and compute Simple Interest.**
   - **Hint:** Use variables `principal`, `rate`, and `time` to calculate `simple_interest` using the formula `SI = (P * R * T) / 100`.

4. **Accept two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the user and calculate the result. (Use if-else conditions)**
   - **Hint:** Use `num1`, `num2` for numbers and `operator` for the operation.

5. **Input two numbers and print which one is greater.**
   - **Hint:** Use `num1` and `num2` to compare and find the greater number.

6. **Convert an amount entered in rupees to USD.**
   - **Hint:** Use `rupees` as input and `usd` as output. You will need an exchange rate (e.g., `exchange_rate = 0.013`).

7. **Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to 'n' terms.**
   - **Hint:** Use `n` for the number of terms and `fib_seq` to store the Fibonacci sequence.

8. **Check if a given string is a palindrome.**
   - **Hint:** Use `string_input` for the input string and check if it is equal to its reverse.

9. **Find all Armstrong numbers between two specified numbers.**
   - **Hint:** Use `lower_limit` and `upper_limit` for the range and iterate through the numbers to check for Armstrong.

10. **Input a year and determine if it's a leap year.**
    - **Hint:** Use `year` for the input and check divisibility conditions to determine a leap year.

11. **Take two numbers as input and display their sum.**
    - **Hint:** Use `num1` and `num2` for inputs and calculate the `sum`.

12. **Accept a number from the user and print its multiplication table.**
    - **Hint:** Use `num` for the number input and use a loop to print its multiplication table.

13. **Input two numbers and calculate both their HCF and LCM.**
    - **Hint:** Use `num1` and `num2` to find `hcf` and `lcm`.

14. **Continuously take numbers as input until the user enters 'x', then display the total sum of all entered numbers.**
    - **Hint:** Use a loop with input `num` and check if `num == 'x'` to stop the loop and calculate the `sum`.

15. **Input a number and print all the factors of that number (use loops).**
    - **Hint:** Use `num` for the input and a loop to find and print all `factors`.

16. **Take integer inputs till the user enters 0 and print the sum of all numbers (HINT: while loop).**
    - **Hint:** Use `num` for the input and a `total_sum` variable to accumulate the sum.

17. **Take integer inputs till the user enters 0 and print the largest number from all.**
    - **Hint:** Use `num` for input and keep track of the `largest_num` entered.

18. **Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer.**
    - **Hint:** Use `num` to extract digits, calculate the `product` and `sum`, then subtract them.

19. **Print Fibonacci Series.**
    - **Hint:** Use `n` for the number of terms and `fib_seq` to store the Fibonacci sequence.

20. **Calculate Average Marks.**
    - **Hint:** Use `marks` as a list of inputs and compute the `average` using the sum and count of marks.
